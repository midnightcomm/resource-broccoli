*Without Doors: [Early America ](https://www.withoutdoorscurriculum.com/early-america)* is a curriculim that "includes the overall framework to successfully implement 28 weeks of lessons in Bible, history, geography, literature, poet study, nature study, artist study, composer study, and hymn study for students in 1st-8th grade."

This project is not connected with [Without Doors](https://www.withoutdoorscurriculum.com/), but serves as a resource list for those using the education plan. This supply list isn't very useful without their curriculm, which is fairly inexpensive.
